Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while, heaven can wait we're only watching the skies. Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst, are you gonna drop the bomb or not? Let us die young or let us live forever. We don't have the power, but we never say never, sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip. The music's for the sad man.
